## Immediate Recommendation

**Stay with Replit + Cloudflare** since:
1. DNS propagation is already in progress
2. Zero additional cost
3. No code changes required
4. SSL will work once DNS completes (12-24 hours)

If you need immediate results and don't mind $5/month, **Railway** offers the fastest migration with zero code changes.

## Next Steps
1. **Wait 24 hours** for Cloudflare DNS propagation
2. If still issues, consider Railway for $5/month
3. For long-term cost optimization, evaluate Vercel free tier

Your current setup should work - DNS propagation just needs more time.
